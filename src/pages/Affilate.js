    <p>On my website, I will occasionally evaluate or mention products and services. If I believe a product or service is good, and the merchant selling it provides an affiliate programme, I have no problem referring others to it via an affiliate link, which means I may receive a commission or other kind of income if you purchase the product I promote.</p>

    <p>Certain items and links to products/services are affiliate links, and any purchases you make may result in a commission for me. I am paid to give my honest opinion on products and/or services on occasion. You will not be charged any additional fees as a result of this.</p>
    
    <p>These items and services are mentioned because I believe in them and wish to assist you in improving your life. I only endorse products or services that I believe will benefit you. Of course, full disclosure: Making Sense of Cents is a for-profit business, which means I do make money from it.</p>
    
    <p>To make things easier for both of us, assume that any links to products or services are affiliate links and that I will be compensated if you buy something. Our disclosure page is created with the help of blogearns' Affiliate disclosure generator.</p>

    <p>Affiliate links are disclosed in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's standards.</p>
